#### I'm a supply chain intelligence analyst at Carrier Corporation concerned with forecasting and optimization.

This portfolio is a work in progress but will include what I hope are useful and informative projects to the reader 
illustrating the data science life cycle with some focus on data sourcing as it is consumes the majority of a data 
scientist's time.  Reliable data goes beyond merely importing CSVs for modeling purposes, thus examples of efficient 
code illustrating the process should be meaningful.  Pushing the data to a database along with retrieving it via SQL 
to report on a modelâ€™s salient features should be illustrative as well.

I'll be focusing on the following areas that I find interesting:
- Recommendation Systems
- Deep Learning
- NLP and AI

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.

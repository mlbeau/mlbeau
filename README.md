## Hi there, I'm Michael. ##

**Founder & Systems Architect at LeanLogic Systems, LLC**  
Builder of **LeanBuild™**, a compliance correctness layer for construction payments.

I design systems that sit between workflows and risk, where statutory requirements, financial operations, and real-world execution collide.

My work focuses on isolating correctness from workflow — building infrastructure that validates, explains, and documents compliance before decisions are made, without displacing human judgment or existing systems.

## ⚙️ What I’m Building
LeanBuild is a construction payment correctness layer that validates lien waivers and payment documentation at payment review, not after funds are already in motion.
It exists because deep statutory validation carries liability that workflow platforms cannot economically absorb.

LeanBuild provides:
* Deterministic, state-specific lien waiver validation
* Confidence-bounded assessments with explicit uncertainty
* Correction guidance with statutory citations
* API-first integration with accounting and workflow platforms 

This is not workflow automation.
It is correctness infrastructure.

Systems Expertise
* Correctness-First Architecture -
  Systems designed around invariant preservation, auditability, and explainability in regulated domains
* API-First Platform Design -
   Modular services built for interoperability with accounting systems, workflow tools, and financial infrastructure
* Construction Payment & Compliance -
   Payment-stage validation, exception handling, and risk-aware payment coordination
* Embedded Finance & Payment Infrastructure -
  Receivables, escrow-adjacent flows, audit-ready reconciliation, and compliance-aware payment design
* Security & Liability Aware Design -
  Scoped permissions, evidence retention, and systems that surface uncertainty rather than obscure it

## Background 
20+ years in data architecture, analytics, and quantitative risk modeling across regulated environments.
I’ve built systems where statutory and policy requirements must survive real-world operational workflows — with correctness, confidence bounds, and auditability treated as first-class design constraints.
LeanBuild is the first production implementation of this approach in construction payments.

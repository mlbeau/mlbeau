#### I'm a supply chain intelligence analyst at Carrier Corporation concerned with forecasting and optimization.

This portfolio is a work in progress but will include what I hope are useful and informative projects to the reader 
touching on key aspects of the data science life cycle.  There will be some focus on data acquisition as it is a  a time consuming phase in the modeling process, thus webscraping examples should prove to be useful.  Pushing the data 
to a database along with retrieving it via SQL for reporting on model features should be illustrative as well.

I'll be focusing on the following areas that I find interesting:
- Recommendation Systems
- Deep Learning
- NLP and AI

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
